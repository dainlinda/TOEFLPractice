# Answer
Different kind of technology has been improving life quality of people. Some says technology is harmful since it spreads unprecedent crime and leaves specific group of people out. Nevertheless, I agree with statement that world got better place due to technology. There are three reasons which support my opinion.

To begin with, the development of technology prolonged one's life span by keeping people safe from danger. In the past, the factor which threatend human being the most was nature. More than bilions of people have died from disease, hunger, and temperature. The development of technology keeps people safe from these factors. People can stay cool in the summer with Air conditional and pan, and stay warm in the winter with heater. People can also survive from drought due to improvement of food saving technology. There is no need to even mention how medical technology improved.

Furthermore, IT technology lets people get more help from others. People in the past were not just ignorant of other's struggles but also did not have many ways to help somebody else. However, IT technology integrated human world. People nowadays can easily get to know if somebody needs help through social media. There was heart-warming news last year. A person who lost her family as a 7 years old kid found her family due to help of the internet after 10 years of time. She uploaded her picture and story on the internet, and it helped her family to find her with her story spreaded all over the world. 

Lastly, technology lets people access to information with less restriction. In the past, some information was only for riches, and poors had no chance of education. These days, technology allows people to easily access to any information they want. Recently developed AI model chatGPT accelerates this phenomenom. People did not just get more opportunity for information but also get more methods to consume information. For example, the auto-generated voice technology helps people with disability can have better access to information. 

With three reasons above, I firmly believe technology is benefficial and world is getting better with technology. Without a technology, people would have had shorter life span, getting less help from each other. Information would have been monopolized by riches without technology.
