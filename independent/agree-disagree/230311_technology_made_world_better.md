# Answer
Different kind of technology has been improving life quality of people. Some says technology is harmful since it spreads ~~unprecedent~~unprecedented crime and leaves specific group of people out. Nevertheless, I agree with statement that world got better place due to technology. There are three reasons which support my opinion.

To begin with, the development of technology prolonged one's life span by keeping people safe from danger. In the past, the factor which ~~threatend~~threatened human being the most was nature. More than ~~bilions~~millions of people have died from disease, hunger, and temperature. The development of technology keeps people safe from these factors. People can stay cool in the summer with Air ~~conditional~~conditioning and pan and stay warm in the winter with heater. People can also survive from drought due to improvement of food saving technology. There is no need to even mention how medical technology improved.

Furthermore, IT technology lets people get more help from others. People in the past were not just ignorant of other's struggles but also did not have many ways to help somebody else. However, IT technology integrated human world. People nowadays can easily get to know if somebody needs help through social media. There was heart-warming news last year. A person who lost her family as a 7 years old kid found her family due to help of the internet after 10 years of time. She uploaded her picture and story on the internet, and it helped her family to find her with her story ~~spreaded~~spread all over the world. 

Lastly, technology lets people access to information with less restriction. In the past, some information was only for riches, and poors had no chance of education. These days, technology allows people to easily access to any information they want. Recently developed AI model chatGPT accelerates this ~~phenomenom~~phenomenon. People did not just get more opportunity for information but also get more methods to consume information. For example, the auto-generated voice technology helps people with disability can have better access to information. 

With three reasons above, I firmly believe technology is ~~benefficial~~beneficial and world is getting better with technology. Without a technology, people would have had shorter life span, getting less help from each other. Information would have been monopolized by riches without technology.

> Your answer provides a good structure and examples to support your stance that technology has made the world a better place to live. However, there are some areas for improvement in terms of grammar, word choice, and organization. Here's a revised version:

Overall, I agree that technology has improved our world in many ways. Firstly, technological advancements have increased our life expectancy by helping us avoid natural dangers. In the past, millions of people died from disease, hunger, and extreme temperatures, but now we have access to air conditioning, heating, and better food preservation methods. Additionally, medical technology has advanced greatly, leading to the discovery of new treatments and cures for previously incurable diseases.

Secondly, technology has brought people closer together by enabling us to connect and help each other. Thanks to the internet and social media, we can easily reach out to those in need, as evidenced by the heartwarming story of the person who was reunited with their family through the power of the internet. IT technology has also provided us with new ways to collaborate and work together, no matter where we are in the world.

Finally, technology has democratized access to information, allowing everyone to learn and grow regardless of their background. In the past, education was limited to the wealthy, but now anyone can access a wealth of information through the internet and new technologies like AI. Even those with disabilities can benefit from voice technology that makes information more accessible.

In conclusion, while some argue that technology has negative effects, I believe that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. Technological advancements have improved our health, increased our ability to help each other, and democratized access to information. It's hard to imagine a world without technology, and I believe that it has made our world a much better place to live.

In summary, I agree that technology has made significant improvements to our world. Firstly, it has increased our life expectancy by protecting us from natural dangers such as disease, hunger, and extreme temperatures through the use of air conditioning, heating, and better food preservation methods. Furthermore, medical technology has advanced significantly, leading to the discovery of new treatments and cures for previously incurable diseases.

Secondly, technology has facilitated human connection and support, as evidenced by the heartwarming story of the individual who reunited with their family through the power of the internet and social media.
