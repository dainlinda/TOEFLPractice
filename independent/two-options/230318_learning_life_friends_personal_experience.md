Some people believe that the best way of learning about life is by listening to the advice of family and friends. Other people believe that the best way of learning about life is through personal experience. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

# Draft
**family and friends**

1. They lived longer life, with different background, which means more experience 
2. Their view is objective, personal one tends to be subjective, cannot see different view
3. Personal experience takes time and pain

# My answer
It is debatable if recieving the advice of family and friends is better, or experience is better to learn about life. Some say the best way to learn about life is via personal experience. However, I believe that getting advices from friends and family is more advantageous than going through personal experience especially to learn about life. There are a few reasons for this, and I will hightligth three.

First of all, one's friends and family can give diverse lessons and opinions about life. This is because they have different backgrounds and some have more experiences than one has. For example, My dad has worked in IT industry for more than 30 years. When I was having difficulty to get a job in the IT industry, he gave me advices such as improving my portfolio, and proof-reading my resume. Which increased my chance to get into the IT industry, and I am hired by my current company as a programmer. I would have not been able to get IT job only with my personal experience.

On top of that, the advice of friends and family is objective whereas one's personal experience can be subjective. Learning about life through personal experience can distort the fact thet should not be neglected. For instance, when I was in a college, I used to believe studying by myself is more effective way to get better scores based on the experience of a high school. However, my friend in the college taught me the way he studies in a study group, and gave me opportunity to join his study group. Which improved my studying skills and I could be in dean's list at the end of the semester. If I fixated to my personal experience, I would have not been able to be in dean's list. 

Lastly, personal experience takes time and effort whereas the advice from your people does not cost anything. It can be painful and time-consuming to learn about life since it requires one to go through some amount of experience. I went through hard time to learn about how to communicate with people. 

For the conclusion, I believe having advices from one's friends and family is the best way to learn about life based on the reasons mentioned above. By getting advices from your friends and family, you can get diverse lessons, and get objective view, and save time to learn about life.
